# Coffee Orders
This contains two classes: Order and Coffee. Order can add as many coffees (provided that the coffee objects are created and each are setup for either or all: a large coffee, containing soy, and/or is an espresso) as needed. The total and GST can be found via the order by .total() and .gst().

# Tests
